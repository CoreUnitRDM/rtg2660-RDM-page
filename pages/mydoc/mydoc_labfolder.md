# Using Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) at Würzburg University

Electronic Lab Notebooks (ELNs) streamline the documentation and management of research data, ensuring compliance with reproducibility and data integrity standards. Würzburg University offers ELNs as part of its **Forschung Digital** services.

---

## **1. What is an ELN?**

An **Electronic Lab Notebook (ELN)** is a digital tool for:
- Documenting experimental workflows.
- Storing research data securely.
- Collaborating with team members.
- Managing protocols, observations, and results.

---

## **2. Why Use ELNs?**

### **Benefits of ELNs**
- **Centralized Data Management**: All research data is stored in one place, reducing redundancy and loss.
- **Enhanced Collaboration**: Share your notes, results, and protocols easily with team members.
- **Searchable Records**: Quickly retrieve past experiments using advanced search functionalities.
- **Data Integrity**: Automatic timestamps and version control ensure that all changes are traceable.

## **5. Using the ELN**

### **Creating a New Experiment**
1. Log in to your ELN account.
2. Navigate to your project dashboard and click **New Experiment**.
3. Fill out the form with:
   - Experiment title.
   - Objective or hypothesis.
   - Materials and methods.
4. Save your work and upload any supplementary files.

### **Sharing Your Experiment**
- Select the experiment you want to share.
- Use the **Share** button to invite collaborators.
- Set permissions (e.g., view-only, edit).

## **6. Best Practices for ELNs**

1. **Document Regularly**:
   - Update your ELN in real-time to avoid forgetting important details.

2. **Organize Experiments**:
   - Use consistent naming conventions for projects and experiments.

3. **Include Metadata**:
   - Provide as much detail as possible for better data interpretation later.

4. **Backup Frequently**:
   - While ELNs are automatically backed up, export your data regularly as an extra precaution.

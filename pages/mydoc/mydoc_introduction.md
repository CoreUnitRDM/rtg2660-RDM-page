## Introduction to RTG2660-Approach and Avoidance

Approach and avoidance behaviors are significant aspects of human psychology, and understanding these mechanisms is essential for better prevention and treatment of behavioral disorders. The Research Training Group "Approach and Avoidance mechanisms" (RTG2660) was established to study behavioral patterns and their underlying mechanisms. By integrating clinical, preclinical, and basic sciences, the unit aims to uncover peripheral and systemic processes involved in approach and avoidance behaviors, along with their CNS control. Our research involving behavioral studies, animal models, and cellular systems has identified crucial factors for approach and avoidance mechanisms. These include specific potassium channel subtypes that affect neuronal excitability, essential barrier proteins, the NGF-IL-7 axis, and sex-specific regulation of macrophage migration to the dorsal root ganglia (DRG). Additionally, approach and avoidance-related genes from Drosophila and human genes involved in behavioral mechanisms were identified through the exploratory projects. Core units for standardizing blood and skin analyses and MR neurography for DRG imaging have been established, facilitating the study of differential effects in approach and avoidance behaviors.

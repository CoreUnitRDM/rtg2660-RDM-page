## Important RTG Resources

We strongly believe in Open Science and therefore reinforce the use of Open Science practices within the projects of the RTG. Our full Open Science Statement can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12elCP0-u0Rwjfe9sa0y41Ld-0VqEqLxa/view?usp=sharing).

As part of our Open Science Strategy, we ask every member of the RTG to fill in our [Study Checklist](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15SgrzeHJDrZSPYwUfwcIcqwTdTiqCXJb/edit#heading=h.30j0zll) for each study they conduct. The study checklist consists of a preregistration, which should be filled out and sent to the scientific coordinator before the beginning of data collection. The second part is a data management plan, which should be filled out for each final data set.
